  "Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver." - 2 Corinthians 9:7

  Your faithful tithes and offerings support our church's ministries and allow us to continue serving our community. We are grateful for your generosity and commitment to God's work.

  You can choose to give a one-time donation or set up recurring giving.
